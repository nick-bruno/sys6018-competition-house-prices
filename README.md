Repository for code for the housing price kaggle competition

Team members:
Nicola Bruno (NHB3ZF)
Sameer Singh (SS8GC)
Wenxi Zhao (WZ8NX)

Responsibilities:
Each member played an important role in each step of the assignment, collaborating to share different techniques and findings in the areas of data exploration and data cleaning. For our parametric approach, we each created unique models and used cross-validation to determine which regression most accurately fit the data. For our non-parametric approach, we used a similar process, and included our multiple non-parametric approaches in the code.
